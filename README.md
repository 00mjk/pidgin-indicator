pidgin-indicator: Ubuntu Indicator Plugin for Pidgin
====================================================

This plugin provides an Ubuntu Indicator icon, for use in the Unity desktop
environment. Unity no longer provides a general purpose notification tray,
so the standard Pidgin tray icon does not appear. The official Ubuntu
alternative is an integration with their Messaging indicator, which
consolidates status from multiple applications. I've found this indicator to
be much less usable than the original Pidgin tray icon, so I decided to
build this plugin to restore the icon's functionality in a maintainable
way (in contrast to having to run a patched version of Unity).

Functionality
-------------

The indicator provides all the same functionality as the original tray icon,
but not in exactly the same way.

* The 'smart' click behaviour that either shows the buddy list or unread
  messages is mapped to the appindicator 'secondary action'.
  * This is because indicators do not get to control what happens on clicks.
    The 'secondary action' is intended to be something done instead of showing
    the menu. It is up to the indicator provider in the destkop environment
    to decide what action triggers the secondary action, if at all.
  * In Unity, a middle-click triggers the secondary action
  * In nome-shell using the AppIndicator/KStatusNotifierItem extension,
    very recent versions now support the same middle-click behaviour as in
    Unity. This extension is installed by default with Ubuntu 17.10.
  * I'm not sure what KDE Plasma does. Some people have said it also
    does secondary activation on a middle click, and some say a left click.
    I think this may have changed over successive releases.
* As the indicator is a separate process from pidgin itself, there are
  sometimes conflicts with Focus Stealing Prevention when you use the
  indicator to go to unread messages. You may need to disable FSP for
  Pidgin to get around this.
* Due to how indicators work, the secondary action must also be a menu
  item, so it's the new Show/Hide item at the top of the menu.
* Due to indicator limitations, some of the special icons can't be shown
  next to menu items any more.
